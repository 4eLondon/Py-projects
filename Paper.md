# Python basics

 **Variables**
: Variables are defined as containers in which values are stored. Strings, integers, boolean and floats are examples of data types that a variable can store. Variables are assigned with the ' = ' operator.

| Variable | Type |
|:---:|---|
|name = "tom"|String|
|age = 23| Integer|
|can_vote = true| Boolean|
|savings = 1020.34|Float|


**Printing**
In Python, printing is done using the `print()` function, which outputs text or other data types to the standard output, typically the console.

: In python variables act as if it were the value it stores.
    For example, We have a variable fruit = "apple".
    if we enter fruit then it will print apple, the value it stores.
     so print (fruit) will print the value apple.  

    One of the easiest ways to view the values of our variables is with the use of **"f-srings"**.
